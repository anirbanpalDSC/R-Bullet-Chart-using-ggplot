# R-Bullet-Chart-using-ggplot
A bullet graph is a variation of a bar graph developed by Stephen Few. Seemingly inspired by the traditional thermometer charts and progress bars found in many dashboards, the bullet graph serves as a replacement for dashboard gauges and meters _(Wikipedia)_. The intention of this project is to create a function that anyone can use and pass simple parameters like target and measures to generate a fully customizable bullet chart that can be used in the code like any other ggplot chart type.
